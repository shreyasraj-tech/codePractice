## 1710. Maximum Units on a Truck

Here is the link to the problem on LeetCode: [1710. Maximum Units on a Truck](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-units-on-a-truck/)

### Problem Description

You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto one truck. You are given a 2D array `boxTypes`, where `boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxes_i, numberOfUnitsPerBox_i]`.

You are also given an integer `truckSize`, which represents the maximum number of boxes that can be put on the truck. You can choose any boxes to put on the truck as long as the number of boxes does not exceed `truckSize`.

The total number of units on the truck is the sum of the number of units in each of the boxes on the truck.

Return the maximum total number of units that can be put on the truck.

### Example 1:

- **Input**: `boxTypes = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]]`, `truckSize = 4`
- **Output**: `8`
- **Explanation**: 
  - There are 1 box with 3 units, 2 boxes with 2 units each, and 3 boxes with 1 unit each.
  - The truck can carry a maximum of 4 boxes.
  - To maximize the number of units, we load 1 box with 3 units and 2 boxes with 2 units each, totaling 8 units.

### Example 2:

- **Input**: `boxTypes = [[5,10],[2,5],[4,7],[3,9]]`, `truckSize = 10`
- **Output**: `91`
- **Explanation**: 
  - There are 5 boxes with 10 units, 2 boxes with 5 units each, 4 boxes with 7 units each, and 3 boxes with 9 units each.
  - The truck can carry a maximum of 10 boxes.
  - To maximize the number of units, we load 3 boxes with 9 units, 4 boxes with 7 units, and 2 boxes with 5 units, totaling 91 units.

### Solution

Here is a Java solution for the problem:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaximumUnitsOnTruck {
    public int maximumUnits(int[][] boxTypes, int truckSize) {
        // Sort the boxTypes array in descending order based on the number of units per box
        Arrays.sort(boxTypes, (a, b) -> b[1] - a[1]);

        int maxUnits = 0;

        // Iterate through the sorted boxTypes array
        for (int[] boxType : boxTypes) {
            int numberOfBoxes = boxType[0];
            int unitsPerBox = boxType[1];

            // Check if the truck can carry all the boxes of this type
            if (truckSize >= numberOfBoxes) {
                // Add all the units from these boxes to the truck
                maxUnits += numberOfBoxes * unitsPerBox;
                // Reduce the remaining capacity by the number of boxes loaded
                truckSize -= numberOfBoxes;
            } else {
                // If the truck cannot carry all the boxes, load as many as possible
                maxUnits += truckSize * unitsPerBox;
                // The truck is now full
                break;
            }
        }

        return maxUnits;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumUnitsOnTruck solution = new MaximumUnitsOnTruck();
        int[][] boxTypes = {{1, 3}, {2, 2}, {3, 1}};
        int truckSize = 4;
        System.out.println("Maximum units on the truck: " + solution.maximumUnits(boxTypes, truckSize));
    }
}
