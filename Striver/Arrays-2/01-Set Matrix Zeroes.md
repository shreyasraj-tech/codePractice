# Set Matrix Zeroes [Leetcodelink](https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/)
---

**Problem Statement**
Given an `m x n` integer matrix, if an element is `0`, set its entire **row** and **column** to `0`.
You must do it **in-place**.

---

## 2. Similar Problems (Same Pattern)

These problems follow the **“marker / in-place optimization”** pattern:

* Game of Life
* Rotate Image
* Zero Matrix (Cracking the Coding Interview)
* Product of Array Except Self
* First Missing Positive

👉 **Common Theme**:
Using **existing space cleverly** to avoid extra memory.

---

## 3. Core Logic Behind the Problem & Challenge

### Core Requirement

* Any `0` affects **entire row + entire column**
* Multiple zeroes may overlap
* Must modify **in-place**

### Main Challenge

* If you set zeroes immediately, you **lose original information**
* Once a row/column is zeroed, you can’t tell whether it was **originally zero**

⚠️ **Key Difficulty**
Avoid cascading zeroes while keeping **O(1) extra space**.

---

## 4. Brute Force Solution & Why It’s Not Acceptable

### Idea

* When a `0` is found:

  * Mark its entire row and column as `0` immediately

### Problem with This

```
Original:
1 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1

After first update:
1 0 1
0 0 0
1 0 1
```

Now new zeroes appear, causing **incorrect cascading updates**.

### Fix Attempt

* Mark affected cells as `-1` temporarily
* Then convert all `-1` to `0`

### Why It’s Not Ideal

* Modifies original data assumptions
* Fails if matrix contains `-1`
* Not clean or safe

---

## 5. All Methods & Logic Explanation

### ❓ Why This Works

* We **never modify** the matrix until we have **complete information**
* The original zero positions are preserved
* No accidental cascading of zeroes

---

### ⚠️ Limitation of This Approach

* Uses extra space:

  * `O(m + n)`
* Not optimal when the problem explicitly demands **O(1)** space

This limitation leads to **Method 3**, where we reuse the matrix itself as memory.

---

### 🧠 Mental Model to Remember

> “**Detect first, modify later. Store decisions separately.**”

Once you understand this, the transition to the optimal in-place solution becomes natural.


---

### ✅ Method 2: Using Temporary Marker Value (Conceptual / Not Recommended)

> This method is **not recommended for interviews**, but it is extremely useful to understand **why naive in-place updates fail** and **how data corruption happens**.

---

## 🔍 Core Idea

When you find a `0` at position `(i, j)`:

* The entire **row `i`**
* The entire **column `j`**

must become `0`.

The problem is:

> If you immediately change them to `0`, you may create **new zeroes** that were **not originally present**, which breaks correctness.

### So the workaround is:

* Do **in-place marking**, but
* Use a **temporary value** (like `-1`) instead of `0`.

This helps distinguish:

* **Original zeroes**
* **Zeroes that are supposed to be set later**

---

## 🧠 Why a Temporary Marker is Needed

Consider:

```
1  1  1
1  0  1
1  1  1
```

If you update immediately:

```
1  0  1
0  0  0
1  0  1
```

Now the newly created `0`s will trigger **additional row/column zeroing**, which is wrong.

### Solution:

Use a marker value (`-1`) to say:

> “This cell must be zero later, but it was NOT originally zero.”

---

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Logic

### Step 1: Traverse the Matrix

* When `matrix[i][j] == 0`:

  * Traverse the entire **row `i`**

    * Change non-zero values to `-1`
  * Traverse the entire **column `j`**

    * Change non-zero values to `-1`

🚫 Do **not** touch existing zeroes.

---

### Step 2: Final Cleanup

* Traverse the matrix again
* Convert all `-1` → `0`

---

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

### Input

```
1  1  1
1  0  1
1  1  1
```

### After Marking Phase

```
1  -1  1
-1  0  -1
1  -1  1
```

### After Cleanup Phase

```
1  0  1
0  0  0
1  0  1
```

✔️ Correct result **in this case**.

---

## ❌ Why This Method Is Dangerous

### 1️⃣ Data Assumption Problem

* Assumes `-1` does **not** exist in input
* Real problems do not guarantee this


```java
class Solution {
    public void setZeroes(int[][] matrix) {
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;

        // Step 1: Mark affected cells with -1
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 0) {
                    // Mark row
                    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                        if (matrix[i][k] != 0) {
                            matrix[i][k] = -1;
                        }
                    }
                    // Mark column
                    for (int k = 0; k < m; k++) {
                        if (matrix[k][j] != 0) {
                            matrix[k][j] = -1;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Convert -1 to 0
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == -1) {
                    matrix[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}


```

### ⚠️ Method 2: Using a Temporary Marker Value (Conceptual Approach)



### 2️⃣ Poor Time Complexity

* Every `0` triggers full row + column scan
* Worst case:
  **O(m × n × (m + n))**

---

### 3️⃣ Conceptually Weak

* Relies on magic values
* Breaks abstraction
* Not scalable or safe

---

## 🧠 What This Method Teaches You

Even though it’s flawed, it teaches **critical lessons**:

* ❌ Immediate in-place updates cause corruption
* ✅ You must preserve original state
* ⚠️ Temporary markers are risky
* 🎯 Leads naturally to:

  * Extra space solution (Method 1)
  * In-place marker optimization (Method 3)

---

## 🧠 Interview Perspective

| Aspect               | Verdict        |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| Correctness          | ⚠️ Conditional |
| Safety               | ❌              |
| Efficiency           | ❌              |
| Interview Acceptance | ❌              |

👉 Use this method **only for understanding**, never as final solution.

### 🔹 Method 3: **Optimal In-Place Solution (Best Method)**

Below is a **logic-first explanation of Method 3 (Optimal In-Place)** followed by the **annotated Java code**.
Read the logic first → the code will feel obvious.

---

## 🧠 Method 3 — Logic + Code (Together)

---

## 🎯 What We Want

* Set an entire **row** and **column** to `0` if any element is `0`
* Do it **in-place**
* Use **O(1)** extra space

---

## 💡 Core Observation

We only need to remember:

* **Which rows** contain a zero
* **Which columns** contain a zero

Instead of extra arrays, we reuse:

* **First row** → column markers
* **First column** → row markers

⚠️ But before reusing them, we must **save their original state**.

---

## 🔐 Step 1 & 2 — Protect First Row and First Column

If we overwrite them without checking, we lose information.

```java
boolean firstRowZero = false;
boolean firstColZero = false;

// Check first row
for (int j = 0; j < matrix[0].length; j++) {
    if (matrix[0][j] == 0) {
        firstRowZero = true;
        break;
    }
}

// Check first column
for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
    if (matrix[i][0] == 0) {
        firstColZero = true;
        break;
    }
}
```

🧠 **Logic**

* These flags remember whether the first row or column must be zeroed **at the end**.

---

## 🧠 Step 3 — Use First Row & Column as Markers

Now we safely record decisions.

```java
for (int i = 1; i < matrix.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < matrix[0].length; j++) {
        if (matrix[i][j] == 0) {
            matrix[i][0] = 0; // mark row
            matrix[0][j] = 0; // mark column
        }
    }
}
```

🧠 **Logic**

* We **do not zero anything yet**
* We only say:

  * “Row `i` needs to be zero”
  * “Column `j` needs to be zero”

---

## 🧠 Step 4 — Apply Markers to Inner Matrix

Now all decisions are known.

```java
for (int i = 1; i < matrix.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 1; j < matrix[0].length; j++) {
        if (matrix[i][0] == 0 || matrix[0][j] == 0) {
            matrix[i][j] = 0;
        }
    }
}
```

🧠 **Logic**

* If row OR column is marked → cell must be zero
* Safe because markers are stable

---

## 🧠 Step 5 — Handle First Row Last

```java
if (firstRowZero) {
    for (int j = 0; j < matrix[0].length; j++) {
        matrix[0][j] = 0;
    }
}
```

🧠 **Logic**

* We delayed this so column markers weren’t destroyed early

---

## 🧠 Step 6 — Handle First Column Last

```java
if (firstColZero) {
    for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
        matrix[i][0] = 0;
    }
}
```

🧠 **Logic**

* Same reasoning as first row

        // Step 1: Check first row

            if (matrix[0][j] == 0) {

                    matrix[0][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 4: Apply zeroes using markers
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][0] == 0 || matrix[0][j] == 0) {
                    matrix[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 5: Zero first row if needed
        if (firstRowZero) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                matrix[0][j] = 0;
            }
        }

        // Step 6: Zero first column if needed
        if (firstColZero) {
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                matrix[i][0] = 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
