## 735. Asteroid Collision

Here is the link to the problem on LeetCode: [735. Asteroid Collision](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/)

### Problem Description

We are given an array of integers `asteroids` representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

Return an array representing the state of the asteroids after all collisions.

### Example 1:

- **Input**: `asteroids = [5, 10, -5]`
- **Output**: `[5, 10]`
- **Explanation**: 
  - The 10 and -5 collide; 10 is larger, so -5 explodes.

### Example 2:

- **Input**: `asteroids = [8, -8]`
- **Output**: `[]`
- **Explanation**: 
  - Both asteroids are equal in size and destroy each other.

### Example 3:

- **Input**: `asteroids = [10, 2, -5]`
- **Output**: `[10]`
- **Explanation**: 
  - The 2 and -5 collide first; -5 destroys 2.
  - Then 10 and -5 collide; 10 survives.

### Solution


```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public int[] asteroidCollision(int[] asteroids) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < asteroids.length; i++) {
            int current = asteroids[i];
            
            if (stack.isEmpty() || current > 0) {
                // No collision if moving right (+)
                stack.push(current);
            } else {
                // Current asteroid is moving left (-)
                while (true) { 
                    int top = stack.peek();
                    
                    if (top < 0) {
                        // Same direction (both negative)
                        stack.push(current);
                        break;
                    }
                    
                    int modVal = Math.abs(current);
                    
                    if (top == modVal) {
                        // Both explode
                        stack.pop();
                        break;
                    } else if (top > modVal) {
                        // Top survives, current explodes
                        break;
                    } else {
                        // Current survives, pop top and check next
                        stack.pop();
                        if (stack.isEmpty()) {
                            stack.push(current);
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Convert stack to array
        int len = stack.size();
        int[] ansArray = new int[len];
        for (int i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            ansArray[i] = stack.pop();
        }

        return ansArray;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Use of Stack**:
   - Stack is used to simulate asteroid positions and resolve collisions.
   - Right-moving asteroids are pushed.
   - Left-moving asteroids check the top of the stack for potential collisions.

2. **Collision Resolution**:
   - If opposite directions meet (positive on top and current negative), compare sizes.
   - Larger one survives.
   - If equal, both explode.
   - Continue until no conflict remains or the stack is empty.

This approach efficiently simulates the asteroid interactions with a time complexity of **O(n)**.
